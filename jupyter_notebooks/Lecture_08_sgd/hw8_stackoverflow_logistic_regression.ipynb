    "In this homework, we will study and program a model for predicting tags in the text of a question based on multiclass logistic regression. Unlike the usual statement of the classification problem (multiclass), in this case, one example can belong to several classes (multilabel) at the same time. We will implement the online version of the multilabel classification algorithm.\n",

    "PS: It can be shown that such an implementation is not at all effective and it would be easier to use vectorized calculations. For this dataset it is. But actually, such implementation is used in real life, but naturally, they are not written in Python. For example, a banner is shown to the user in the [CTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-through_rate) forecasting online models, then, depending on the presence of a click, the model parameters are updated. In real life, the parameters of the model can be several hundred million. But usually, in such sparse data, not none parameters belonging to the user would be less than 100k. Often all this is stored in huge clusters in in-memory databases, and user processing is distributed.\n",
